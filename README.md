Liverwort-growth-rate-analysis
==============================

This is analysis of a growth rate experiment performed on mutant and Wild type lines of *Marchantia polymorpha* for my PhD. Ten individual gemmae of each line were plated up on day 0, and were photographed once every 24 hours over the period of 5 days. Their positions were randomised on a 10 x 10 grid.

The perimeter of each growing gemma was drawn freehand in ImageJ, and this data was analysed in an IPython notebook using the Pandas package.

A second round of this experiment was performed with different lines. See the second round [here](https://github.com/linbug/Round-two-liverwort-growth-rate-analysis/tree/master)
